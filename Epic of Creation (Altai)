In the Altai creation epic, it is told that in the beginning, everywhere was covered with water. God Ulgen transforms into a bird and flies over the waters, but cannot find a place to land. Thereupon, a voice from the sky tells the god Ülgen to land on a stone that comes out of the sea. When Ülgen is placed on this stone, he thinks that the earth and sky should be created, but he does not know how to do this. White Ana, the female spirit living in the waters, tells Ülgen how to carry out the creation. God, who started work with his help, first created the earth and then the sky. Then he created three fish to balance the world. The fishes supported the world from below and prevented it from wandering.
